General format:
newmtl <name>                      // defines the name of a material
convert <start> <end> <values ...> // from wavelengths ranging from start to end, each wavelength will convert to the specified value
diffuse <start> <end> <values ...> // (RAYTRACING ONLY) transforms diffuse values
specular <start> <end> <values ...> // (RAYTRACING ONLY) transforms specular values
ambient <start> <end> <values ...> // the default ambient color of the material (RECOMMENDED to be ZERO)
absorb <start> <end> <values ...> // from wavelengths ranging from start to end, specifies the % each wavelength should return when light hits this material
ior <start> <end> <values ...> // from wavelengths ranging from start to end, specifies the index of refraction for each wavelength
transmission <start> <end> <values ...> // from wavelengths ranging from start to end, specifies the transmission (how much energy for every unit of 1.0 when traveling through a volume)
shiny <value> // (RAYTRACING ONLY) specular shiny
type <dielectric/lambertian> // specifies either lambertian or dielectric, lambertians are diffuse surfaces and dielectrics are transmissive/reflective surfaces
diffract <true/false> // specifies if it should diffract or not


General notes:
1. If <start> and <end> are both 0, the transform will default to y=x, or in other words any input's output will just be the input. If both are 0, then you do not need to specify values
2. You do not have to specify a value for every single wavelength, the parser will interpolate the fourier transform for missing values. They will, however, be uniformly scattered across the range.
3. The spectral renderer is configured from range 100nm to 700nm wavelengths. Please try to use that range when defining material properties. Note that ~400-700nm is the spectrum of VISIBLE light (100-300 is ultraviolet, so useful for fluorescent materials)
4. Material properties do not all have to be defined, if you do not define them they will default to some other value
